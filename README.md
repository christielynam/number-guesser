# number-guesser

When the game loads, a random number is generated. The input field directs the player to guess a number between 1-100. If the player selects a number outside the range or inputs data other than numbers, they will get an alert stating they must enter a numeric value between 1-100.
When the player submits their guess, the input is evaluated to determine if it is a number within the directed range. If it is, the number is then evaluated to compare the players entry and the random number. After each guess, the player is informed of their previous number and told if that number is too high or too low. If the correct number is selected, the computer displays 'BOOM!' You can reset the game at any time to generate a new random number and return the game to its zero state.
